# tick_tac_toe
Welcome to my Tic-Tac-Toe game!

You can play it [here](https://hughsin23.github.io/tic-tac-toe/)

## approach
This project uses a combination of HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
I solved the problem of determining who won the game of tic-tac-toe was checking each winning combination in the grid.

In order to check this, I assigned classes columns and rows and winning diagonals in the HTML file, then had a function check if any of those combinations were true.

I kept track of player wins with a counter. 

### technologies used
I used self-recorded audio for a unique experience, as well as a lovely animation from [animista](https://animista.net/). I also used DOM manipulation to replace the entire grid in HTML once the user clicks the 3x3 or 5x5 grid button.
